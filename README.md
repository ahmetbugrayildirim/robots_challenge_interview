Welcome dev!

You'll be building a simple search app today. The objective of this challenge is to understand your capacity for real-time data handling, efficient data filtering, state management, and problem-solving.

The boilerplate code that you need to work with is in App.tsx. 
For simplicity, there's no need to create new files, please modify the code inside App.tsx. 

- It's required to have **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** installed on the computer
- It's required to have **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** installed and configured on the computer
- Also, it's required to have a package manager either **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)** or **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)**.

**PLEASE, WE KINDLY ASK YOU TO TURN OFF ANY AI ASSISTANCE IN THE IDE**
  
**Clone the repository:**

```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/paulo-carvalho93/robots_challenge_interview.git
```

**How to run:**

```sh
  # Installing project dependencies
  $ yarn # or npm install
  
  # Start Web Project
  $ yarn vite # or npm vite
```

**Requirements:**

Here are all the following features we'd like to see in this search app:

1. The default state of the app should display a list of all robots and the text input empty (search bar).
2. The list should get updated in real-time as the user enters a text inside the search bar.
3. Only robots whose name/username/email match with the search query should be shown. (Each robot has an image, name, username, and email).
4. The filtering should also make sure that it filters robots out not just based on an exact match but also on substrings.
5. The search shouldn't be case-sensitive.

Once you are done, please create a new branch with your name and push your changes to the repository. 

Feel free to ask any questions if you need to. 
Good luck!
